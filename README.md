hack tinker tanker
have randm directories, password protect.
have 1 dir that can be accessed, but is empty
have hidden file in that dir.
Hidden file is also psasword protected, but the passwords can be found by puzzle. 
In the file is lots of passwords that are all encrypted (caesar cypher or something harder?) and are passwords for the other directories. 

...

start a python program
python program doesnt work. They have to debug it.
There is a complex set of conditionals with the different outcomes of launching missiles or don't. The bug is in there.
If they read the conditionals carefully, they will fix it such that when it runs it wont launch the missiles.
if they just fix the syntax errors, it will launch. 
OR
Python program runs, they have to solve the conditionals, input the correct variable or it will launch missiles.
