someone is trying to launch nuclear missiles. IP address returns to tinker tanker.
hack tinker tanker
have randm directories, password protect.
have 1 dir that can be accessed, but is empty
have hidden file in that dir.
Hidden file is also psasword protected, but the passwords can be found by puzzle. 
In the file is lots of passwords that are all encrypted (caesar cypher or something harder?) and are passwords for the other directories. 

...

1st line: socket --> zip password --> nuclear file
2nd line: hidden file --> encrypted password with caesar cipher --> nuclear password
caesar cipher with no looping, so going into ascii characters


start a python program
python program doesnt work. They have to debug it.
There is a complex set of conditionals with the different outcomes of launching missiles or don't. The bug is in there.
If they read the conditionals carefully, they will fix it such that when it runs it wont launch the missiles.
if they just fix the syntax errors, it will launch. 
OR
Python program runs, they have to solve the conditionals, input the correct variable or it will launch missiles.



1. hidden file
2. file that only root can access (chmod 400)
3. password protected zip files
4. someplace to put encrypted passwords
5. python program that pulls data from somewhere for something else using sockets

Debug program to start socket connection to akmal

6. social engineering: chat thing, make them contact akmal to extract password from that guy --> to the accomplice
accomplice checks whether they really are the right guy, and they need to go to .profile to find the details of the person
ok you're the right guy: here's the password for you know what
you get password to file with encrypted password

FIle with encrypted passwords contains password to socket program

file that only root can access is the stopping missiles thing, and the password for root can only be gotten from the socket program

Final objective: run a program that prevents missiles from launching

nuclear user has the nuclear program which they need to stop
